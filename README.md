### Things to consider
- The first time you enter the page, you may have to reload due to a bug.
- Code refactoring was performed but due to this same bug, it could not be added to the deploy or to the main branch.
- I started with the Bonus: detail of a Pokémon, but I couldn't make much progress because I was delayed in starting due to memory problems in my computer. I also advanced a little slow because I didn't remember how to use Typescript.
